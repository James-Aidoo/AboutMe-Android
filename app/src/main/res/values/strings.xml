    <string name="bio">Hi, I\'m Lafayette!
        \nInstead of talking about myself, I\m gonna give you an extract
        lyrics to Guns and Ships from Hamilton.
        \n\n"I\'m taking this horse by the reins
        \nMaking redcoats redder with bloodstains
        \n\nLafayette!
        \n\nAnd I\'m never gonna stop until I make \'em drop
        \nAnd burn \'em up and scatter the remains
        \nI\'m—Lafayette!
        \nWatch me engaging \'em, escaping \'em, enraging \'em, ow
        \n\nLafayette!
        \nI go to France for more funds
        \nLafayette!
        \nI come back with more guns
        \nAnd ships
        \nAnd so the balance shifts…"\n
